Fonts and colors were not showing until I did the following...
(I'm running tailwindcss v3.0.23)

1) Run the following command in the terminal:
npx tailwindcss init

This creates a file tailwind.config.js in the root directory i.e. same directory as package.json

2) Update the file content as follows:

module.exports = {
  content: [
    './public/**/*.{html,js}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

3) Run the following command in the terminal:
npm run build-css

4) Run the following command in the terminal:
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./public/style.css --watch

That did it for me!
